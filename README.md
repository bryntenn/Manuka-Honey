I plan on using the data file I uploaded previously to compare those MIC values to their cooresponding antibiotic. I Would like to do an one-way anova on MIC and antibiotic and a T-test on antibiotic class and MIC.
The explanatory variable will be the antibiotic/class
The response variable will be the MIC value
Assumptions are Normal distribution (checked by histogram or scatter plot), homogeniety of variance (Leveneâ€™s test), and independent observations (assuming since this is not my data). The assumptions for the T test will be similar with the addition of the assumption is the data collected is on a continous scale.
I expect to see a correlation between antibiotic and MIC, however I am not sure what to expect from antibiotics within the same classification. I predict that there will be a relationship between class of antibiotic and MIC.
I will interpret these results based off P-values and T-values.
